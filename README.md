# Object Detection and Instance Segmentation 🚀

## Overview 🗂

This repository focuses on implementing object detection and instance segmentation models. It includes the following key functionalities:
- **Object Detection**: Identify and localize objects in images or videos.
- **Instance Segmentation**: Segment individual objects at a pixel level.

The project is designed for research and development purposes and is built with modularity and customization in mind.
