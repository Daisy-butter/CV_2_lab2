## Overview 🗂

## Overview 🗂

This repository aims to implement **object detection** and **instance segmentation** tasks using models from the [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) framework, specifically focusing on **Mask R-CNN** and **Sparse R-CNN**. 🛠

The project is designed to utilize the **Pascal VOC 2007** dataset as the benchmark for training and evaluation. It contains:
1. **Modified Code Files** from the MMDetection framework, tailored for this project.
2. **Custom Scripts** added for enhanced functionalities.

**Key Highlights**:
- **Mask R-CNN**: Combines bounding box detection with pixel-level instance segmentation.
- **Sparse R-CNN**: Employs sparse prediction with learnable proposal boxes.

Stay tuned for results and findings! 🚀
